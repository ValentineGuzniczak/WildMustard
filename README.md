## Contents

- **"dead"**: RGB pictures of a plant with the **highest herbicide dose** and **lowest irrigation** over time.
- **"flower"**: RGB pictures of a **control plant** (no herbicide) with **highest irrigation** over time.
- **"R700"**: Reflectance at the **wavelength 700nm** over time for the three irrigation deficit levels.
- **"Reflectance_drought_XX"**: Full **reflectance spectra** for a given level of irrigation deficit.

## Methods summary
- Wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis)
- 3 levels of deficit irrigation (80%, 50% , and 30% of field capacity (FC)) (n=24 per level)
- 8 doses of metsulfuron methyl, LAS inhibitor herbicide (n=4 per dose per irrigation deficit  level)
- Measurements
  - Non-destructive through a fully automated high-throughput phenotyping platform over 28 days after spraying 
  - Destructive at the end of the 28 days
- Analysis
  - Dose-response analysis for all endpoints and measuring times
  - Benchmark dose estimation
